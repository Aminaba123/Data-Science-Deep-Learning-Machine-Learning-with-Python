# Activity 3

In this activity, tried to review the basic commands of [Python](https://www.python.org), by writing a code to create random numbers and then recogonize if it is an odd number or not. there are two files in this folder:

[even_number.py](): That generates random numbers, and then finds the odd numbers 
[even_number_m.py](): Works similar to [even_number.py](), but was written in a style more similar to [MATLAB]() and [Octave]() styles.
