# Activity 3

In this activity, tried to review the basic commands of [Python](https://www.python.org), by writing a code to create random numbers and then recogonize if it is an odd number or not. there are two files in this folder:

[even_number.py](https://github.com/arasharn/Data-Science-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/Activities/Activity%203/even_number.py): That generates random numbers, and then finds the odd numbers 
[even_number_m.py](https://github.com/arasharn/Data-Science-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/Activities/Activity%203/even_number_m.py): Works similar to [even_number.py](https://github.com/arasharn/Data-Science-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/Activities/Activity%203/even_number.py), but was written in a style more similar to [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) styles.
